# output image as 8 bit greyscale rather than changing alpha
# Read Gamma File into a gamma list 
# Increment contrast with mouse data, use gamma list to correlate contrast to 8-bit greyscale
# Add a "b" character trap to allow the baseline to be captures
  - Note the capture in the log file 
# Add a "r" character trap to allow the clinician to revert the contrast back to baseline 
  - Note the capture in the log file
